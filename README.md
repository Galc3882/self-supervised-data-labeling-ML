# Self Supervised Data Labeling ML
A self-supervised data labeling ML YoloX with multi-GPU training and automatic hyperparameter tuning.
# Introduction
I completed the Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch and Intro To Self Driving Cars Nanodegree by Udacity on August 9th, 2022. I had the opportunity to sharpen my Python skills and apply C++ while implementing matrices and calculus in code. Additionally, I was able to touch on computer vision and machine learning all in the context of solving self-driving car problems.

# Datasets
The dataset used for this project is the LISA Traffic Light Dataset. The database consists of continuous test and training video sequences, totaling 43,007 frames and 113,888 annotated traffic lights. The dataset is available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbornoe/lisa-traffic-light-dataset.

I wanted to test the self-supervised data labeling and model on an entirely different dataset. I found the dataset from this [MIT self-driving car course](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/).

```

# Self Supervised Data Labeling
I created a method to self label the traffic lights to "go", "stop", and "warning". This method creates three masks for each image (red, yellow, green). Then it calculates the probability of each label using weights and cutoffs.
For the LISA dataset, the results were:
```
Training set:
Correct:  74096 / 74955  Accuracy: 98.85 %
Will stop when supposed to go accuracy: 1.02%  Go incorrect: 0.12%
```
```
Testing set:
Correct:  18536 / 18739  Accuracy: 98.92 %
Will stop when supposed to go accuracy: 0.99%  Go incorrect: 0.10%
```

For the MIT dataset, the results were:
```
Correct:  1408 / 1484  Accuracy: 94.88 %
Will stop when supposed to go accuracy: 3.84%  Go incorrect: 1.28%
```
