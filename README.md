# Self Supervised Data Labeling ML
A self-supervised data labeling ML YoloX with multi-GPU training and automatic hyperparameter tuning.
# Introduction
I completed the Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch and Intro To Self Driving Cars Nanodegree by Udacity on August 9th, 2022. I had the opportunity to sharpen my Python skills and apply C++ while implementing matrices and calculus in code. Additionally, I was able to touch on computer vision and machine learning all in the context of solving self-driving car problems.

# Self Supervised Data Labeling
I created a method...

# YoloX

# Multi-GPU Training and Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning

# Requirements and file architecture:
### Imports:
```python
import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import cv2
```
## Instructions:
- Put all the pictures in the input folder. 
- Run segmentation_mask.py.
- Your segmentation masks will be in the folder named output.
