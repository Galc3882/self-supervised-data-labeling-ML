# self-supervised-data-labeling-ML
A self-supervised data labeling ML YoloX with multi-GPU training and automatic hyperparameter tuning.

I completed the Intro To Self Driving Cars Nanodegree by Udacity on August 9th, 2022. I had the opportunity to sharpen my Python skills and apply C++ while implementing matrices and calculus in code. Additionally, I was able to touch on computer vision and machine learning all in the context of solving self-driving car problems.
